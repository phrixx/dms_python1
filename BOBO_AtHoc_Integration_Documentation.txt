================================================================================

1. OVERVIEW

The BOBO processor is a Python-based integration tool that processes BOBO worker duty status data and synchronizes it with AtHoc emergency notification systems. This tool monitors CSV files containing worker duty status information and automatically updates corresponding user records in AtHoc, enabling real-time tracking of who is on duty and available to receive emergency notifications.

================================================================================

2. KEY FEATURES

• Automated Processing: Monitors CSV files and processes duty status updates automatically
• Intelligent Batching: Groups multiple CSV files for efficient single-batch processing  
• User Mapping: Maintains a local database mapping employee IDs to AtHoc usernames
• Scheduled Sync: Daily user mapping synchronization with configurable timing
• Error Recovery: Robust error handling with automatic retries and logging
• Safe File Management: Files only moved after successful AtHoc sync confirmation
• Comprehensive Logging: Multi-level logging with automatic rotation and cleanup
• Batch Processing: Efficient bulk updates to AtHoc using native APIs
• Safe Updates: Only modifies duty status fields, never changes user enable/disable status
• Conflict Resolution: Latest timestamp wins when multiple updates exist for same employee

================================================================================

3. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

• Python 3.7 or higher
• Network access to AtHoc server
• Read access to BOBO CSV output files
• Write access for database and log files

8.2 Enhanced Batch Processing

The system uses intelligent batching for optimal performance and data safety:

1. File Collection: All available CSV files are collected into a single processing batch
2. Memory Processing: Files are parsed and stored in memory without being moved
3. Conflict Resolution: When multiple records exist for the same employee, the latest timestamp wins
4. Single API Call: All updates are sent to AtHoc in one batch operation
5. Safe File Handling: Files are only moved to processed directory after successful AtHoc confirmation
6. Retry Safety: On failure, all files remain in source directory for next processing attempt

Benefits:
• 10x fewer API calls: One batch update instead of per-file updates
• Data Safety: No file loss if sync fails
• Consistency: All updates applied atomically
• Conflict Resolution: Automatic handling of duplicate employee updates

8.3 Data Flow

8.3.1 BOBO CSV Input
Worker duty status exported from BOBO system:
Employee_ID,Status,Timestamp
12345,On Duty,2024-06-17 14:30:00
67890,Off Duty,2024-06-17 14:31:00

8.3.2 User Mapping Database
Local SQLite database mapping employee IDs to AtHoc usernames:
employee_id | username              | collar_id | last_updated
12345      | john.doe@company.com  | 12345     | 2024-06-17 20:00:00
67890      | jane.smith@company.com| 67890     | 2024-06-17 20:00:00

8.3.3 AtHoc User Update
Duty status synchronized to AtHoc custom fields:
{
  "LOGIN_ID": "john.doe@company.com",
  "On-Duty-DTG": "17/06/2024 14:30:00"
}

8.4 User Mapping Sync Schedule

The system automatically syncs user mappings from AtHoc on the following schedule:
• Daily: After configured hour (default: 8pm) and not already done today
• Immediate: If more than configured days (default: 2) since last successful sync
• Retry: If last sync returned no data or encountered errors
• First Run: If never synced before

================================================================================

9. DATABASE STRUCTURE

9.1 Worker Mappings Table

);

9.2 Processing Log Table
CREATE TABLE processing_log (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    processed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    entries_processed INTEGER,
    success_count INTEGER,
    error_count INTEGER,
    errors TEXT
);

9.3 Sync Tracking Table

• Batch processing summaries
• User mapping sync operations
• File management operations
• Configuration validation

DEBUG Level:
• Individual user sync details
• Detailed API responses
• User mapping details per user
• File parsing details

WARNING Level:
• Non-critical errors
• Missing user mappings
• API warnings
• Configuration deprecations

ERROR Level:
• Processing failures
• Connection issues

================================================================================

11. TROUBLESHOOTING

For comprehensive troubleshooting procedures, see the Process Guide (process.md) 
which includes detailed diagnostic steps, code locations, and emergency procedures.

11.1 Quick Reference - Common Issues

11.1.1 Connection Problems
Check AtHoc connectivity:
curl -k https://your-athoc-server.com/api/health

Verify SSL settings (for development environments only):
DISABLE_SSL_VERIFY=true

11.1.2 User Mapping Issues
Check user attributes configuration:
USER_ATTRIBUTES=Collar-Number,FIRSTNAME,LASTNAME

Verify field names in AtHoc match configuration:
COLLAR_ID_FIELD=Collar-Number
DUTY_STATUS_FIELD=On-Duty-DTG

11.1.3 File Processing Problems
Ensure CSV directory exists and is readable:
ls -la /path/to/csv/directory

Check file permissions:
chmod 755 /path/to/csv/directory

Verify files aren't moved prematurely:
Files should only be in processed directory after successful AtHoc sync

11.1.4 Batch Processing Issues
Check if files are stuck in source directory:
This indicates AtHoc sync failures - check logs for API errors

Verify BATCH_SIZE isn't too large for AtHoc server:
BATCH_SIZE=10  (Reduce if getting timeout errors)

Check for timestamp format issues:
CSV timestamps must be parseable for conflict resolution

11.2 Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting environment variable:
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python bobo_processor.py

Or modify code for persistent debug logging:
logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

11.3 Manual Testing
Test AtHoc connection:
from athoc_client import AtHocClient
client = AtHocClient()
print("Connection successful!")

Test user mapping:
from bobo_processor import BOBOProcessor
processor = BOBOProcessor()
users = processor.athoc_client.get_all_users_with_attributes(['Collar-Number'])
print(f"Found {len(users)} users")

Test batch processing:
batch_files = processor.collect_csv_files()
print(f"Found {len(batch_files)} files to process")

================================================================================

12. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

• Store .env file securely and never commit to version control
• Use service accounts with minimal required permissions
• Enable SSL verification in production environments
• Regularly rotate AtHoc credentials
• Monitor log files for suspicious activity
• Safe User Management: Tool only updates duty status fields and respects existing user enable/disable states
• Data Integrity: Batch processing ensures all-or-nothing updates to prevent partial data corruption
• File Safety: Files remain available for retry if AtHoc sync fails

================================================================================

13. PERFORMANCE

13.1 Optimization Settings
• BATCH_SIZE: Adjust based on AtHoc server capacity (default: 10)
• SYNC_HOUR: Schedule during low-traffic periods
• AUTO_CLEANUP_HOURS: Balance between accuracy and performance
• LOG_LEVEL: Use INFO in production to minimize log file size

13.2 Monitoring
• Monitor log files for batch processing times and success rates
• Track user mapping sync success rates
• Monitor AtHoc API response times and error rates
• Set up alerts for processing failures and file accumulation
• Batch Efficiency: Monitor API call reduction from batch processing

13.3 Performance Benefits
• Reduced API Load: Single batch call vs. multiple individual calls
• Faster Processing: Memory-based file handling vs. disk I/O per file
• Network Efficiency: Fewer HTTP requests to AtHoc server
• Atomic Operations: All updates succeed or fail together
